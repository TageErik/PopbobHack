How to check for backdoors in src files:

Step 1: Download MCP v8.11

Step 2: Download the newest MCPReady from releases

Step 3: Unzip MCPReady, rename it to to minecraft and paste it into mcp/src

Step 4: Backup the folder

Step 5: run recompile.bat

Step 6: run reobfuscate.bat

Step 7: The names of the class files in mcp/reobf are the obfuscated names of all the files that have been edited. Use the obfuscation mappings in mcp/conf/client.srg to find out what the deobfuscated names of the files are.

Step 8: setup mcp with popbobhack in the backup. I actually don't know how to do this but it's probably easy

Step 9: Open popbobhack mcp in some cool editor you like

Step 10: Download normal mcp and decompile it and open it

Step 11: Use a text difference checker to see which parts I added or removed in the files that were edited.

Step 12: blame obama if you fail at something
